##### Where to download the SDK?

##### How to use the SDK?
The SDK provides three functions:
1) start() - Begin recording the session
2) tagEvent() - Record specific event
3) end() - Stop recording session

Note: Mobile Metrics SDK defines a session as a period between the open and close of a single app.

See the JavaDocs for more specific implementation info.
