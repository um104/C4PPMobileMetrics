line graphs events over time line aspect of stuff happening over time
most likely care about (massive marktet campeigh how much did this stuff happen growth of events ovet time most importatnt)

predefine
session data / time
events / time

counting sessions over time

incorprate other data in time graph so it will be easy how offteen does this event /attrribute happen over

 time



graph event all different attribute can be displayed on the same graph.

linegraphs for session for other evnt and attirbutes all oever time

work on UI clean up, get other views on mockup. linegraphs make sure it fits in screen postitioned should be ok and landscape/portrait fine.

Pie/Bar same datatable 
Predefined graphs work well avoid extra custom graphs (stretch goal)

sperate table of references to different sessions would be faster
