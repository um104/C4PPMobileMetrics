To install the SDK, download the "mobilemetricssdk.jar" file and place it in your Android projects "libs" folder. Then, with your project selected, go to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries and select "Add JARs", adding the JAR that you just placed in the "libs" folder.

To configure your Salesforce.com credentials so that the SDK can use them, open your res/values/strings.xml file. Copy the following code in between the <resources> tags:

    <string-array name="MobileMetricsCredentials">
        <item>client_id</item>
        <item>client_secret</item>
        <item>username</item>
        <item>password</item>
        <item>security_token</item>
    </string-array>

Replace the fields between each <item> tag with the actual credentials.

To determine your client_id and client_secret, see step one here:
http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api_rest/index_Left.htm#CSHID=quickstart_oauth.htm|StartTopic=Content%2Fquickstart_oauth.htm|SkinName=webhelp

Your username and password are the username and password of your org, or of one account of your org.

To determine your security_token, see this link:
