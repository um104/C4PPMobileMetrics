To build the SDK JAR, use the provided build.xml file and Apache ANT to compile all .java files within src/ and gen/. (Note: depending on the build.xml file, there may be a "build-jar" target that will complete this entire process.) Then, use "jar" to package all of the .class files that came from the files in src/. The files should be located in bin/classes. This will exlude any R.java files, as well as BuildConfig.java.
